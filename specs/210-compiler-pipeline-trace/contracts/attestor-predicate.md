# Contract: `compiler-invocation/v0.1` attestor predicate

**Date**: 2026-07-19
**Purpose**: Lock the URI + JSON shape of the new attestor entry so downstream consumers (SBOMit, witness verify, in-toto policy engines, custom parsers) can parse mikebom-produced attestations without breakage across releases.

## C-1: Predicate URI

**Locked**: `https://mikebom.dev/attestation/compiler-invocation/v0.1`

Per Clarifications Q3 — mikebom-owned URI, no upstream coordination overhead. Documented in `docs/architecture/attestations.md`. Version bump (v0.2, v1, etc.) MUST retain the `/compiler-invocation/` path prefix for URI-aliasing forward compatibility.

## C-2: Wire shape (LOCKED)

## C-3: Field ordering (LOCKED per FR-011 byte-identity)

- Top-level fields serialize in the order listed above.
- `invocations[]` sorted by `(start_timestamp_ns, pid)` tuple.
- `read_set[]` sorted by `path` lexicographically (byte-order).
- `write_set[]` sorted by `path` lexicographically.
- `dag_edges[]` sorted by `(parent_invocation_id, child_invocation_id)`.
- `filter_categories_applied[]` sorted lexicographically.

## C-4: Backward compatibility

- Fields with `null` values in the wire shape MUST be omitted from JSON via `serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")` — pre-m210 attestations without a `compiler_pipeline` section deserialize as `None` cleanly.
- Adding NEW fields to `CompilerInvocation` in future versions is source-compatible: existing consumers ignore unknown fields per `serde_json` default behavior.
- REMOVING a field or changing a field's type is a breaking change — requires URI bump to `v0.2` or higher.

## C-5: Consumer expectations

Downstream consumers of this predicate MUST be able to:
1. Deserialize the `attestation` block into their own data model (they don't have to use mikebom's exact struct names).
2. Reconstruct the DAG from `dag_edges` + `invocations[].parent_invocation_id` (which are redundant on purpose — either alone suffices).
3. Handle `completeness.state == "degraded"` by surfacing the drop-count to their operator (not silently dropping the data).
4. Handle `read_set[i].kind == "stdin_input"` by NOT expecting a `sha256` field (the wire shape omits it).
5. Treat `write_set[i].sha256 == null` as "file was deleted before the trace ended" — NOT as an integrity failure.
